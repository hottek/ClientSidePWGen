# Client-Side Password Generator  
This current mix of a Flask App with JavaScript generates a password and checks wheter the hash of that password has been cracked or not. This is done using the [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords) - API.  
The Flask Server is currently only used for testing purposes.
