# Client-Side Password Generator  
This little script written in JavaScript generates a password and checks wheter the hash of that password has been cracked, leaked or not. This is done using the [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords) - API.  
The script runs entirely on the browser of the client. To try it out, just open the `index.html` in your favorite browser.
